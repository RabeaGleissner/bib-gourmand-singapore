- name: 'Zaffron Kitchen (East Coast)'
  address: '135-137 East Coast Road, Singapore'
  opinion: "This family-friendly bistro flaunts a faux-industrial look, complete with metal-framed chairs in coordinated colours, exposed brick walls, and an open kitchen. Despite the on-trend décor and tech-savvy iPad menu, the cooking is conventional Northern Indian, with dishes from the tandoor being particular highlights. Fresh ingredients are seasoned with the purest spices to great effect and the popular set lunch on weekdays offers excellent value."
